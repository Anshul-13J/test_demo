I am Anshul Nigam, I completed my 12th in 2019 and took admission in KIET in 2020. 

I was born and raised in Lucknow. I also completed my schooling from Lucknow.

I studied C++ in school, then learned Python and C by myself. I am also a part of a club named Innogeeks in my college why I learn about IoT.
Also, I am doing an course on AI, where I am learning the basics. These domains excites me a lot and I love to explore these domains.
I also try to manage studies with other activities (which I don't know how I manage to do, xD). I secured 9.25 sgpa in sem-I.
Also, I love to explore other things in phone like flashing custom ROMs, and exploring different modules.I also know how to change my phone's battery (xD).
I also know how to speak Spanish which I learned by my own, although I am not very fluent.

My fields of interest is technology, and I do love to play badminton.
